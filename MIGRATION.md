# Migration :heart:

Thank you for considering helping us migrating to AngularDart version 7!

Below is the complete checklist. Since we're unsure about what pages are not up-to-date, the best way is to simply to go through each one and mark that off after we verify that it is indeed up-to-date.

If you want to / have checked and taken care of a page: 
1. Create a new issue with the title as "Update $pageTitle", and mention in the description whether you want to do it or have finished doing it. 
2. Submit a pull request if something needs changing, or say that nothing needs changing. We will mark you as the person working on that page as soon as we see it, and cross that off once done. 
3. Just please don't close the issue by yourself after finish updating because we might forget to update this list. 

There can be more than one people working on one page at the same time. Just make sure to not fight with each other and be nice. :P

Lastly, please make sure it's not a duplicate issue (but we will definitely not blame you anyway).

As always, if you're confused about the little procedure here, ignore everything above and create an issue and say what you think needs to change or want to change, and we'll be happy to help you out. :)
